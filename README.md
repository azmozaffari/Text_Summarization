# Text_Summarization


## Overview
The summarization approaches in the literature is divided into two main branches:

### 1- Extractive summarization
In this group of models the LLM decides which sentence is importatnt in the text and highlight that.

### 2- Abstractive summarization: 
 In this approach the text is divided into chunks and later each chunks is shortened and combined, rephrased to make the final output.
